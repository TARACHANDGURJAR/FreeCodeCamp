  <span class="mysubtitle">1.Introduction</span>
    <p>
      Narendra Damodardas Modi ( born 17 September 1950) is the 14th and current Prime Minister of India, in office since 26 May 2014.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="well col-xs-12">
 <span class="mysubtitle">  2.Early Life</span>
  <p>At 17, he made an extraordinary decision, which changed the course of his life. He decided to leave home and travel across India.
He was drawn to politics in his early teens and was a member of Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh (RSS). During the 1960's India-Pakistan war, even though he was only a young boy, he volunteered to serve soldiers traveling through railway stations.The party began getting political attention and formed a coalition government in April 1990. After this, the BJP came to power in Gujarat in 1995. During this period, Modi was responsible for the Somnath to Ayodhya Rath Yatra and a similar trek from Kanyakumari in Southern India all the way up to Kashmir in the north.</p></div>

     <span class="mysubtitle">  3. Early political career</span>
<p> He became a regular member of the RSS and his dedication and organisation skills impressed Vakil Saheb and others. In 1972 he became a Pracharak, giving his full time to the RSS. He shared his accommodation with other Pracharaks and followed a rigorous daily routine.Recognizing his contribution in the RSS and his active participation in the anti-Emergency movement during 1977, he was given additional responsibilities. Growing step by step, he was soon made in charge of the Student wing of the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad in Gujarat.A careful observation of his rise to the national podium would evince how he remained glued to his fundamentals - continuing agitations during the nationwide Emergency, organizing Murli Manohar Joshi's Ekta yatra (journey for unity), and impressing everyone with electoral strategy ahead of the 1995 state elections. As BJP tasted victory, Modi relished his newly ordained post of the party's General Secretary.</p>

  <span class="mysubtitle">4.Political Career</span>
    <p>Times were turbulent in Gujarat with allegations of corruption and poor governance doing the rounds. After Shankarsingh Vaghela left the BJP, Keshubhai Patel was made Chief Minister of Gujarat and Modi became General Secretary of the party in Delhi. Weak handling of the effects of the Bhuj Earthquake in 2001 prompted the BJP's national leaders to seek a new candidate as chief minister, after the removal of Keshubhai Patel. In October 2001, Modi was brought in to fill the vacuum and made Chief Minister of Gujarat despite his lack of experience in governance. Initially, the BJP was not very keen on having him at the forefront and the party was contemplating the position of deputy CM for him, which he refused. He wrote to Advani, and the then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, stating that he was either "going to be fully responsible for Gujarat or not at all." In July 2007, he became the longest-serving Chief Minister in Gujarat's political history.
In the Gujarat legislative assembly elections of 2012, Narendra Modi won the constituency of Maninagar over the Indian National Congress, with a majority of 86,373 votes. The BJP won 115 out of the 182 seats and formed its government in Gujarat. This was Narendra Modi's fourth term as the Chief Minister.</p>

    <b> NaMo Saga - From Tea Seller to Prime Minister

It's an interesting story of a man who recently stormed into 7, Race Course Road. And, he did not achieve this feat without struggle. Narendra Modi had worked his way to the top post of India's Prime Minister. His rise through the ranks is meteoric, to say the least. As he charts his future course, it would be rewarding to look back at those years when he steadily shaped himself as a national leader.</b></div>
